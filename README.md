# Emotion-Detector


This repository contains a Python-based Emotion Recognizer built using machine learning models and deep learning techniques. The model is capable of recognizing emotions from camera.

## Features

- Recognize emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.
- Model built using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jameelhamzayev/Emotion-Detector.git
   cd Emotion-Detector
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` should include necessary libraries such as `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`, `opencv-python`, etc.




## Model Details

The emotion recognition model uses deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Training data may consist of datasets like FER-2013 (Facial Expressions), EmoReact (Text), or Emovox (Speech).
